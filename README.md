Advanced Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of advanced algorithms and data structures in Java, based on the "Advanced Algorithms in Java" course by Marcos Costa. The course emphasizes practical understanding and application of algorithms to optimize code performance and memory usage.

Course Highlights:

Pattern Matching Algorithms: Lempel-Ziv-Welch, Huffman Compression, Prefix Tree, Suffix Trie, Suffix Tree
Boyer Moore Algorithm: Two versions (simple and complex)
Suffix Tree Implementation: Optimized from O(nÂ²) to O(n)
Benefits:

Deep understanding of complex algorithms
Improved problem-solving skills
Enhanced Java coding efficiency
Better interview confidence
Who Should Use This Repo:

Java developers looking to advance their skills
Students aiming to master algorithms and data structures
